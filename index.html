(#) Syllabus

This course provides an overview of the key concepts and algorithms of Reinforcement Learning, an area of artificial intelligence research responsible for recent achievements such as AlphaGo and robotic control. Students will implement learning algorithms for simple tasks such as mazes and pong games.

## Grading

- 40%: Take-home Midterm
- 40%: Final Project
- 20%: Assignments

### Take-home Midterm

The midterm will test material from the first half of the class. It will be open-note, but collaboration is not allowed. We will schedule office hours during the midterm to in order to clarify questions or review material.

### Final Project

Either solo or in pairs, students will create agents for an OpenAI environment and demo their agent on the final day of classes. A rubric will be provided when once this project is assigned.

### Assignments

We will give a mix of in-class and short homework assignments. The assignments will vary between problem sets and short coding problems. Assignments will be given every other week.

## Academic Policies

### Academic Integrity

Note that academic dishonesty includes not only cheating, fabrication, and plagiarism, but also includes helping other students commit acts of academic dishonesty by allowing them to obtain copies of your work. In short, all submitted work must be your own. Cases of academic dishonesty will be pursued to the fullest extent possible as stipulated by the [Office of Student Conduct](https://www.studentconduct.umd.edu).

It is very important for you to be aware of the consequences of cheating, fabrication, facilitation, and plagiarism. For more information on the Code of Academic Integrity or the Student Honor Council, please visit [here](http://www.shc.umd.eduâ€‹).

### Excused Absence and Academic Accommodations

See the section titled "Attendance, Absences, or Missed Assignments" available [here](http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html).

### Disability Support Accommodations

See the section titled "Accessibility" available [here](http://www.ugst.umd.edu/courserelatedpolicies.html).

### Course Evaluations

If you have a suggestion for improving this class, don't hesitate to tell the instructor or TAs during the semester. At the end of the semester, please don't forget to provide your feedback using the campus-wide CourseEvalUM system. Your comments will help make this class better.
